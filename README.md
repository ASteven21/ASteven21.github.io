## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- In this challenge, I learned about `background-repeat: space` to get the right number of stars for the project.

### Continued development

- I hope to be able to get better at dealing with background images since it still took me a lot of time in order to get its position right.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K27WULzr2P8&t=3412s) - I learned about `background-repeat: space` from Kevin's video about this exact same challenge.
